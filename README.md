# Data-Structure-Algorithm-Projects
Projects I did for my Data Structures and Algorithms course.

### Student House Simulator
A program for simulating the distribution of student houses using queue.

### Discrete Event Simulation
A discrete event simulation with priority queues that models the operations of a tennis foundation as a discrete sequence of events in time

### Love Story
A project that find a shortest path in a honeymoon route. There is a map represented as a graph which has an articulation point that divides the graph into two parts while one of the parts designed to be directed and the other part is designed to be undirected. Project's aim is finding the shortest path between two nodes in the directed part of the graph and finding the minimum spanning tree on the undirected part of the graph

- Dijkstra's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm are used

### Help the Santa Claus
A project that finds the maximum number of gifts that can be delivered from different type of bags to different type of vehicles

- Dinic's Algorithm is used
